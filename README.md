## Objectives

The project was created to engage K12 kids in STEM learning. The purpose of the project is to provide a companion robot for these kids, combining a human follower device with an aiming apparatus.

## Project Description

The project consists of a 4-wheeled robot (2 motorized and 2 independent wheels) controlled by an ultrasonic sensor. If the distance between the user and the robot is equal to or less than 20 cm, the robot moves forwards. Otherwise, it stays stationary. Through a remote controller, the user can turn the robot on/off, adjust the speed (two options), and instruct the robot to make left/right turns. Moreover, a target attached to the chassis of the robot provides an additional entertainment to the user.
